If the target is an object, you restore points to your Might or Speed Pool equal to the level of the target. If the target is a manifest cypher, it is fully drained and useless. Artifacts and similar devices must immediately check for depletion (items with a depletion of "-" are either immune to this ability or have a depletion of 1 in 1d10 when attacked with this ability).
